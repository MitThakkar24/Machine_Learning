# Simple Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Simple Linear Regression algorithm in Python. Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. In this case, it focuses on predicting the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.


## Introduction

### What is Simple Linear Regression?
Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental statistical method used for predictive analysis in machine learning. It involves a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y). The model estimates the slope and intercept of the line of best fit, representing the relationship between the variables. The slope indicates the change in the dependent variable for each unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept signifies the predicted dependent variable value when the independent variable is zero.

In essence, simple linear regression captures a linear relationship between the input (X-axis) and output (Y-axis) variables. It is the most basic form of linear regression and is employed when there's only one input variable. This method provides a straightforward way to understand and quantify the relationship between variables in a predictive modeling context.

### Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as a simple demonstration of how to implement Simple Linear Regression in Python. It includes a basic implementation of the algorithm and an example to showcase its usage.

## How it Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the dataset, ensuring that the data is suitable for linear regression analysis.

2. **Model Training**: Use the least squares method to estimate the coefficients(Constant and Slope) that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data points.

4. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the model using relevant metrics, such as mean squared error or R-squared.
